## Usage

### Step 1: Generate JSON Report

Run security-checker with the `--json` flag:

```bash
# Check npm packages
security-checker package-lock.json --json report.json

# Check Python packages
security-checker requirements.txt --json python-report.json

# With ignore list
security-checker package.json --ignore .securityignore.json --json filtered-report.json
```

### Step 2: Open the Viewer

Open `viewer.html` in any modern web browser:

**macOS:**
```bash
open viewer.html
```

**Windows:**
```bash
start viewer.html
```

**Linux:**
```bash
xdg-open viewer.html
```

**Or:** Simply double-click `viewer.html` in your file explorer.

### Step 3: Load Your Report

Two methods to load your JSON report:

**Method 1: Click to Browse**
1. Click the upload box in the center of the page
2. Navigate to your JSON file
3. Select and open

**Method 2: Drag and Drop**
1. Drag your JSON file from file explorer
2. Drop it onto the upload box
3. Report loads automatically

### Step 4: Explore Vulnerabilities

**View Summary:**
- Top section shows key metrics
- Severity breakdown with color-coded badges
- At-a-glance understanding of your security posture

**Search:**
- Type package name in "Search Package" field
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Case-insensitive matching

**Filter by Severity:**
- Select dropdown: All, Critical, High, Moderate, Low, Unknown
- Instantly shows only matching vulnerabilities
- Combine with search for precise results

**Filter by Source:**
- Choose: All Sources, OSV, npm Registry, PyPI
- See which database found specific issues
- Useful for understanding coverage

**Sort Results:**
- Default: Severity (highest first)
- By Package Name: Alphabetical listing
- By Source: Group by vulnerability database

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Focus on Critical Issues

1. Generate report: `security-checker package-lock.json --json report.json`
2. Open viewer: `open viewer.html`
3. Load `report.json`
4. Set "Filter by Severity" ‚Üí **Critical**
5. Address these issues first

### Workflow 2: Check Specific Package

1. Load your JSON report
2. Type package name in search (e.g., "lodash")
3. See all vulnerabilities for that package
4. Click advisory links for details

### Workflow 3: Compare Sources

1. Load report
2. Filter by "OSV" ‚Üí note count
3. Filter by "npm Registry" ‚Üí note count
4. Filter by "PyPI" ‚Üí note count
5. Understand which sources provide most coverage

### Workflow 4: Progressive Remediation

**Week 1:**
- Filter: Severity = Critical
- Fix all critical issues
- Generate new report

**Week 2:**
- Filter: Severity = High
- Fix high severity issues
- Generate new report

**Week 3:**
- Filter: Severity = Moderate
- Address moderate issues
- Repeat as needed

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (latest)
- ‚úÖ Safari (latest)
- ‚úÖ Opera (latest)

**No server required** - runs entirely in the browser using JavaScript.

## Technical Details

### File Structure

The viewer is a single HTML file containing:
- HTML structure
- Embedded CSS styles
- Embedded JavaScript logic

### Data Format

Expects JSON in this format:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalDependencies": 100,
    "vulnerablePackages": 15,
    "vulnerabilitiesFound": 23,
    "percentageVulnerable": 15.0,
    "bySeverity": {
      "critical": 3,
      "high": 7,
      "moderate": 10,
      "low": 3,
      "unknown": 0
    }
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "package": "lodash",
      "version": "4.17.15",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "description": "Vulnerability description",
      "cveIds": ["CVE-2020-8203"],
      "advisoryLinks": ["https://..."],
      "suggestedUpgrade": "4.17.21",
      "source": "OSV"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Privacy & Security

- **No data transmission**: All processing happens locally
- **No external dependencies**: Self-contained HTML file
- **No tracking**: No analytics or telemetry
- **Offline capable**: Works without internet connection after loading

## Tips & Best Practices

### Performance
- The viewer handles reports with 1000+ vulnerabilities smoothly
- Filtering and sorting are instant
- Scrolling is optimized for large lists

### Sharing Reports
- JSON files are portable and shareable
- Send `viewer.html` + `report.json` to teammates
- No installation required for recipients

### Regular Scanning
- Generate reports weekly/monthly
- Compare counts over time manually
- Track remediation progress

### CI/CD Integration
- Generate JSON in CI pipeline
- Archive as build artifact
- Download and view locally

### Custom Styling
- The viewer is a single HTML file
- Edit CSS styles to match your brand
- Modify colors, fonts, layouts as needed

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While using the viewer:
- **Tab**: Navigate between filter controls
- **Enter**: Apply filter/search
- **Esc**: Clear search (when focused)
- **Ctrl/Cmd + F**: Browser find for searching within descriptions

## Troubleshooting

### "Error parsing JSON file"
- Ensure the file is valid JSON
- Check the file was generated by security-checker
- Try regenerating the report

### No vulnerabilities showing
- Check your filters - may be too restrictive
- Verify JSON contains vulnerabilities array
- Try "All Severities" and "All Sources"

### Upload not working
- File must have `.json` extension
- Try click-to-browse instead of drag-drop
- Check browser console for errors

### Styling looks broken
- Ensure you're using a modern browser
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors
